If your neighborhood is anything like ours, walking across the street is like taking your life in your own hands. Drivers are increasingly unconcerned by such trivialities as speed limits or staying under control, and anything goes when they need to connect Point A to Point B in the least amount of time possible. <a href="https://www.rtl-sdr.com/measuring-traffic-in-a-neighborhood-with-kerberossdr-and-passive-radar/">Monitoring traffic with this passive radar</a> will not do a thing to slow drivers down, but it's a pretty cool hack that will at least yield some insights into traffic patterns.

The principle behind active radar - the kind police use to catch speeders in every neighborhood but yours - is simple: send a microwave signal towards a moving object, measure the frequency shift in the reflected signal, and do a little math to calculate the relative velocity. A passive radar like the one described in the RTL-SDR.com article linked above is quite different. Rather than painting a target with an RF signal, it relies on signals from other transmitters, such as terrestrial TV or radio outlets in the area. Two different receivers are used, both with directional antennas. One points to the area to be monitored, while the other points directly to the transmitter. By comparing signals reflected off moving objects received by the former against the reference signal from the latter, information about the distance and velocity of objects in the target area can be obtained.

The RTL-SDR test used a pair of cheap <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/05/24/on-point-the-yagi-antenna/">Yagi antennas</a> for a nearby DVB-T channel to feed their KerberosSDR four-channel coherent SDR, a device <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/09/10/direction-finding-and-passive-radar-with-rtl-sdr/">we last looked at</a> when it was still in beta. Essentially four SDR dongles on a common board, it's available now for $149. Using it to build a passive radar might not save the neighborhood, but it could be a lot of fun to try.
