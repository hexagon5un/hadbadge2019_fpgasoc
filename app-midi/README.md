This directory shows you how to turn a MIDI file into something you can use on the badge.

## Background

The badge has a built-in rudimentary synthesizer, and it's pretty easy to write a music player for it.  You'll need source material, but for that, there's the entire library of all music ever out there on the Interwebs, saved in Standard MIDI Format.  Then you need to translate it into something that our little synth understands.

That's where this demo comes in.  

## Prerequisites

You'll need Python, and then to install the "mido" MIDI library.  `pip install mido` did it for me.
